Introduction
The project has been finished completely upon running will allow user input to alter the pose of the human like figure.

How to run
To run my project you will have to download the contents by clicking the green code button and downloading zip file.

Once done that you will unzip that file and open your program environment and create a new C++ project. I personally use Visual Studio 2022. Once your new project is
created you will need to take the contents of the zip folder and place them in the project folder wherever that is on your computer. Make sure that everything stays in 
one folder or else it won't run. If you use visual studio 2022 you will need to go to solution explorer and add existing items, make sure to add all Header, c++. Upon 
running you will see the figure animated going through the maximum and minimum mostions. You will then be able to press 0, 1, 2, 3 to change to a static pose 
corresponding to that number (0 = pose 0) then to make the figure animate between poses you will have to press 'f' for pose 0 - pose 1, b for pose 0 - pose 2 and g for 
pose 0 - pose 3.
