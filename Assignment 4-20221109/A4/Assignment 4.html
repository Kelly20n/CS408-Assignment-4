<p class=MsoNormal>In this assignment, you will write a 3D graphics program to
display hierarchical kinematic models. You can make use of a starter program
provided with this assignment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Create a program to display a 3D wooden model. If working in C++/OpenGL, you can download the
"simple model of a person" (Main.cpp, Main.h) from this assignment. </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The given model has a spherical head, a cylindrical neck, a
cylindrical torso, a left leg made of two cylinders, and a left arm made of two
cylinders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your displayed model should have the above features plus (1)
right arm, (2) right leg, (3) nose, (4) two ears, (5) two feet  on the end of
the legs!, and (6) some other body part(s) of your choosing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Add motion to the right arm, right leg, two feet, and any
other body part(s).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Draw the tree corresponding to the model corresponding to
your program from question 1. Show the Constant, Variable, and Node
transformations on the diagram. You do <u>not</u> have to show any transformations
in the display_cylinder or display_* functions, where * is some body part. We
will consider those transformations to be part of the objects. Your picture can be submitted as a neatly hand drawn picture or a picture drawn with some drawing software. Hand drawn pictures can be scanned as PDFs/JPGs and submitted to UR Courses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Construct a table with columns for the Node Index, Object
Model (e.g., "Neck"), Parent Index, Constant Transformation, Variable
Transformation, Node Transformation, and Child Indices for your program from
question 1. See the example table in the lecture slides (but add more columns). For the Constant
Transformation, you should have X, Y, and Z columns, and for the Variable
Transformation, you should have one column that indicates whether the transform
is Rx (meaning rotation around the X axis), Ry, or Rz and two other columns
giving the minimum and maximum amounts of rotation that you think are
reasonable for a human-like body. See also question 4. Submit the answer in a Word/txt/pdf/Excel file showing the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Change the program from question 1 to use separate
minimum and maximum values for every limb (instead of just giving them all minimum
0 and maximum 45). Adjust the minimum and maximum values in your table for
question 3 according to your experience of what a human body is capable of in
these types of motions. Suggestion: add two arrays, one for max and one for
min. For each joint, the figure should progress from its current setting to the
maximum and then down to the minimum and then back to the maximum, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. A <b>pose vector</b> gives the current values for the
parameters of the Variable Transformations. For example, the angle by which the
wooden figure is leaning forward its neck is given by theta[1] in the program.  Determine
the pose vector corresponding to the following configurations:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>pose
0: figure standing straight with legs straight down and arms straight out;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>pose
1: figure standing with upper right arm straight out and lower right arm turned
straight up; right leg out in kicking motion;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>pose
2: figure standing with upper left arm straight out and lower left arm turned
straight up; lower part of right leg back</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Submit the answer in a
Word/txt/pdf/Excel file showing three pose vectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. Change the program from question 1 to perform animations
between poses. Animation can be performed by gradually changing the angle
parameters of the Variable Transformations between one pose and another and
back and repeat.  Create three possible animations by setting the initial and
final poses:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
input 'f', set one pose to be pose 0 and the other to be pose 1. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
input 'b', set one pose to be pose 0 and the other to be pose 2.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-18.0pt'>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Add
more poses of your choice and choose a keyboard key to cause the figure to
animate motion between those two poses.</p>
